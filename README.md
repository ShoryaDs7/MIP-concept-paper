## What is MIP?

The Modern-day Internet Protocol (MIP) is a proposed foundational framework for deterministic, stable, machine-native interaction with the human web.

Today's web was built for humans — not machines. MIP introduces a new conceptual philosophy describing how agents should:

- **perceive** the web
- **normalize** it
- **interpret** meaning
- **act deterministically**
- **maintain identity** across change

## 📄 MIP Concept Paper v0.1

The full conceptual paper defining:

- why the web needs a new protocol
- the design principles of MIP
- the perception → normalization → interpretation → action cycle
- abstraction layers (Snapshot, TVDOM, IR, Action Model)
- early validation
- use cases

## 📘 Upcoming Work

This repository will expand to include:

- **MIP Technical Specification (v1.0 draft)**
  
  The formal protocol definition including normative requirements, identity model, action semantics, and compliance rules.

- **Reference Implementations**
  
  Prototype examples demonstrating how MIP principles operate on real interfaces.

- **Diagrams, models, and additional papers**
  
  To support understanding and adoption.
